{"name":"13k-alchemist-defence","tagline":"game made for the 13kjs challenge","body":"13k-alchemist-defence\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI made this for the http://js13kgames.com/ challenge.\r\n\r\n[You can play it here](http://platane.github.io/13k-alchemist-defence/sources/app.html)\r\n\r\nI submit it in a rush so it's far to be quite finished. Apologies.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThe theme was the four elements : fire, earth, water, air. \r\n\r\nSo let's say you are a famous alchimist, poorly drawn spartans runs toward your home and they looks angry.\r\n\r\nUse your powers to defend your laboratory, build defences.\r\n\r\nEach element give a unique capacity for the tower, it's possible to combine elements to upgrade the tower.\r\n\r\nJust kinding ! I didn't have the time to implement this, so it's pretty basic actually.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe game is played in a isometric 3D view.\r\n\r\nThe map can be rotated when dragging it, which allows to see hidden spot and produce a nice effect.\r\n\r\nDrag and drop an element from the right menu into the map to build a tower.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
