alchemist defence
=====================

![the game]( http://platane.github.io/13k-alchemist-defence/images/global.png )

I made this for the [js13kgames](http://js13kgames.com/) challenge.

[You can play it here](http://platane.github.io/13k-alchemist-defence/sources/app.html)

I submit it in a rush so it's far to be quite finished. Apologies.

Background
==========

The theme was the four elements : fire, earth, water, air. 

So let's say you are a famous alchimist, poorly drawn spartans runs toward your home and they looks angry.

Use your powers to defend your laboratory, build defences.

Each element give a unique capacity for the tower, it's possible to combine elements to upgrade the tower.

Just kinding ! I didn't have the time to implement this, so it's pretty basic actually.

Gameplay
=======

The game is played in a isometric 3D view.

The map can be rotated when dragging it, which allows to see hidden spot and produce a nice effect.

Drag and drop an element from the right menu into the map to build a tower.
