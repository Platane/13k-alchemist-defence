	<p>Hello, nice to see you here.</p>
	<p>Here is the plot, let's say you are a alchimist which masterize the power of combining elements.</p>
	<p>Such a power draws attention, an army of spartans are walking toward you.</p>
	<p>Fortunately alchemy will help you to push them back, use your power to build tower to destroy them.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>So in short, it's a tower defence. Drag elements from the right panel to the map to build a tower which will automatically shoots at enemy.</p>
	<p>You can upgrade a tower by dragging some more elements on it ( or at least this was planned, it's currently very restricted)</p>
	<p>Try to rotate the map by dragging it, it's pretty cool</p>
	<p>That's pretty much all, as you can see the game lacks of some core features, enjoy as much as you can</p>
